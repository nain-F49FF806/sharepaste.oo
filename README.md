# Share Paste O₂

## Introduction

Share Paste is a [privatebin](https://privatebin.net/) client for android.

This app allows you to quickly share text, in such a way that the hosting privatebin server
can't read contents of the paste you have shared. Or in other words, your share is _end to end encrypted_.
Also you can set your paste to expire and auto destruct 💣 after a set duration. Or burn
on read 🔥 (Mission Impossible style) if you like, to prevent unintended persons from accessing it later.

**What you might use this for?**

* You have to share some sensitive info quick and your messenger does not support E2EE
  (or you can't trust it's security enough).
* You need to share some text on a forums/discord/irc but don't want it to linger online for eternity.
* You want to post something anonymously that should be visible only for limited duration.
* You love burn on read feature just cuz, or wish to surprise someone with a special message. Happy Birthday ;)
* And more. Use your imagination!

### Where to get it?

[<img src="https://fdroid.gitlab.io/artwork/badge/get-it-on.png"
    alt="Get it on F-Droid"
    height="80">](https://f-droid.org/packages/alt.nainapps.sharepaste.fdroid/)

You can also download apk directly from GitHub. Please see [releases](https://github.com/nain-F49FF806/sharepaste.oo/releases).

## How it works?

In short:

1. A secure key is randomly generated and used to encrypt your paste, _on device_. #local
2. The _encrypted paste_ is sent to the server, who responds with location of your _temporarily_ saved opaque paste. #remote
3. The paste location and the secret used to derive key are merged into a link that you can share with intended receiver.

When receiver opens the link, the encrypted paste is retrieved, and _decrypted locally_, with server none the wiser regarding it's contents.
If set to Burn On Read, the server also _immediately_ deletes the paste after it has been retrieved once.

## Usage / Wiki

Please find features+screenshots in [wiki](https://github.com/nain-F49FF806/sharepaste.oo/wiki/sharepaste.oo-Features).

## Developer section

This app is powered by Kotlin 🏝️ and Rust 🦀.  

* Encryption and sending uses Rust code, using the same library that powers [pbcli].
* UI is written in Jetpack Compose with Kotlin helping wrap the Rust library.
* Bridging between Rust world and Java/Kotlin world is thanks to UniFFI project by Mozilla.

### How to build

#### Source the code

This project sources the pbcli library dependency as a git submodule.
Assuming you have already cloned this repository like so.

    git clone https://github.com/nain-F49FF806/sharepaste.oo.git

Next we need to init and retrieve the submodule

    git submodule update --init 

(Optionally) Enable app version auto increment on new commit.

    ln -s ../../.githooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/

#### Rust the environment

You will need [cargo-ndk](https://github.com/bbqsrc/cargo-ndk) installed to build this library for Android.

    cargo install cargo-ndk@3.5.4 --locked
    rustup target add aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi

#### Android the Studio

After above you should be able to open the `android` folder in Android Studio, and build in a few steps

* Open sdk manager and [install a recent / recommennded NDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/install-ndk)
* Open Build Variants tool window, and for app module select flavor you want (default source-ambientRelease is safe bet)
* `Build` menu > `Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)` > `Build Apk`

Voila! If you do have trouble, please [open an issue](https://github.com/nain-F49FF806/sharepaste.oo/issues).

### Build variants / flavors

This app comes in 3 flavors, with only difference being the icons used / theme customization to help tell the source.

|     | flavor                | purpose                                                                                                       |
| --- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **ambient** (default) | You should use this for local builds or redistribution. You may replace the icon, but not adapt or modify it. |
| 2   | **fdroid**            | This flavor is for official f-droid distribution.                                                              |
| 3   | **original**          | This is for builds from the original source repo. you are not granted rights to use media from this flavor.   |

Contributions are welcome. Both, code and non-code contributions are appreciated.

Any code contributions shall be assumed to come with same license as the repository,
unless you explicitly make additional grants.

Some ideas / Current to do:

* ~~Receive text share intents, so we can encrypt the shared text~~ [[done](https://github.com/nain-F49FF806/sharepaste.oo/commit/1830278f96e2c414f7b7f2355b6ef0442f909950)]
* ~~Receive arbitrary file share intents, so we can  encrypt as attachment~~ [[done](https://github.com/nain-F49FF806/sharepaste.oo/commit/cd487f0c074903cfbf08fe1dda6b54c9684f8a5f)]
* Keep a record of shared links (configurable), and their expiry date/time

Once Share Paste is aware of attachments, we can start opening (decryption) links locally.
