This app allows you to quickly share text, and optionally an attachment, in such manner that the hosting server cannot read paste contents.
In other words, your share is end to end encrypted. You can set your paste to expire 💣 after a set duration.
Or burn on read 🔥 (Mission Impossible style!), to prevent unintended persons from accessing it later.

If you know of PrivateBin, this is the first and only mobile client for it that we know of :)

Enjoy sharing your pastes privately!


Built with love 🫶, Kotlin 🏝️  and Rust 🦀.
